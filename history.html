    <p class= "frontpage"> The history of watches goes some time back in history.
      Usually most people agree that Peter Henlein is the father of portable clocks,
      though there is no direct evidence he was the first.<br>

      Watches evolved from accessoires for the rich instead of actual useful devices that could
      accurately tell the time. They were so inaccurate that they were basicly useless.
      <br><br>

      Some time later there were portable <i>spring-driven clocks</i>. These watches
      were just basic devices that still inaccurately showed the time. Some speculate that
      watches were called 'watches', because mostly watchmen used to keep track of
      their shifts.
      <br><br>
      In 1657 though, a revolutionary invention, the 'balance spring',<br> improved the watch's
      accuracy to only be a few minutes off<br> each day, instead of a few hours. This also
      made the minute<br> hand a possibility.<!-- misschien een foto van dat /-->
      This caused a two-century lasting innovation<br> period where watches were
      constantly improving.
      <br></br>
      In the coming century watches became pretty accurate devices that could
      be easily carried with you, without being bothered by for example temperature
      or movement. Still, for the most part watches were worn by the elite, mainly
      because manufacturing was still done by hand.
      <br>
      That changed in the mid-19th century. In the United States someone named Aaron
      Lufkin Dennison opened up shop in 1851 and in 1861 he was running a succesful
      enterprise.
      <br><br>
      From 1920 technology improved very fast. In WW1 there was a great nead for
      sturdy wristwatches, because synchronization between artillery and the foot soldiers
      was very important.
      <br><br>
      In 1950 the first electric watches were invented, which were quickly replaced
      by the quartz watches in 1970. These watches were almost in every way better
      than mechanicly driven watches. Yet interestingly the most expensive watches are still mechanicly
      driven watches.
      <br><br>
      The radio-controlled wristwatch correct itself every day. Governments could
      broadcast signals so that your clock was able to reset itself every day.
      These watches are pretty uncommen, since quartz watches work almost just as
      good as these one and they look better.
      <br><br>
      A few years ago atomic watches and smartwatches were invented. Atomic watches
      are so precise that they had an accuracy of one second in a 1000 years.
      Smartwatches are still new and improving. Most of them have a touch screen and
      they can some apps. The future primarily lies with these watches, but some
      people that still like mechanical watches are paying big money for
      them.
