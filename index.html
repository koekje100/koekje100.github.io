    <p class= "frontpage">Hi, this is a website about watches. I always <i>watch</i>
      if someone wears a watch. Aside from being very nice to wear, they also give a person a
      lot of style. I don't know why, but whenever someone wears one, I instantly like them more.
      There is just something about watches that gives a person a nice look, <!-- Pas op met de foto pik.-->
      <br>
      especially when someone wears them with a suit or blouse.<br>It is a really fun
      thing to match your watch with your suit and<br>to see everything just fitting together.
      <br><br>
       To be completly honest, I actually didn't give a dime about<br> watches when I was younger.
      Never even noticed the things.<br> But that changed big time when I needed a watch I
      started to<br> go to high school. I needed a way to check the time to see if I<br> was going fast enough.
      <br><br>
      So I asked my mom if she could get me one. At that age, I didn't really think about
      how expensive a watch could be, nor would I care back then.
      <br>
      So she gave a random black cheap watch. It doesn't look special or has a lot of style,
      but after all these years I still wear my faithful companion almost every day.
      The wrist strap is now almost broken, and I'll take that a sign for when I'm
      gonna get a new one. Not that I'll throw my first buddy in the garbage bin,
      he'll always have a special place in my heart and will never be forgotten.
