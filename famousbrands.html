    <strong class="subheadings">Patek Philippe & Co.</strong>
    <br><br>
    This is sort of the top of the chain of all the companies. They are famous
    for their mechanical watches, They look very nice; they give you that
    rich status. But that's also because of the price. These badboys cost a couple
    of hundred thousand dollars. Though that is the price of the most expensive ones,
    the average is not for your casual watch-wearer.
    <br><br>
    <strong class="subheadings">Rolex</strong>
    <br><br>
    Rolex's are also very expensive watches. They mostly focus on mechanical watches
    with steel wristbands. At least, that is what they are famous for. According to the
    watch-community, Rolex is more for the type of people who have a lot of money,
    but just buy expensive stuff for the reason it's expensive. They don't have
    any style and if you would ask a real expert what he thinks about your Rolex,
    he would probably laugh in your face. But that is what they say, if you think
    the watch is beautiful, who are they to stop you. Let's get this straight: the
    watches are not bad, some just think they don't bring class and style.
    <br><br>
    <strong class="subheadings">Jaeger-LeCoultre</strong>
    <br><br>
    Jaeger-LeCoultre is also one of the premium brands. Its status being that they're
    good, but not the best or the most expensive. Though a Jeager-LeCoultre watches
    is still weared by big businessmen. It brings a different style of watches to
    the table, which is a very good thing to have. So you should look if these types
    are something for you. If they aren't, that's completly fine. And if they are,
    you have to be willing to put down a few thousand dollars for the cheapest one.
    <br><br>
    <strong class="subheadings">Seiko Holdings Corporation</strong>
    <br><br>
    Most of the the name is shortened down to Seiko. It is a Japanese brand. Normally
    that wouldn't be so special, but in the world of watches or rather, the history of
    watches it really was. You see, almost every watch came from the western world and
    when Seiko joined the group, most companies excluded them from competitions and such.
    However, evantually they were accepted by them and after that Seiko joined the big boys.
    Now, Seiko brings a noteably different style than the European and American watches.
    This brand is from the list here the most accessible for regular consumers, with a
    few more expensive ones. If you want some style that is different from most, this brand
    is probably for you.
