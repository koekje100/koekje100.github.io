    <h1 class= "pageheader">Types of watches</h1>

    <p class= "frontpage">There are many kinds of watches, and even more sub-categories.
      The list would inmensly big if they were all listed here. So I'll go over all
      the main categories with some explanation on how they work, so you might get an
      idea about what you like more. Also don't forget that every kind has an average price,
      but the prices still always range from cheap to expensive. So a normally cheap
      type can have a some expensive units in it.
      <br><br><br>
      <strong class= "subheadings">Mechanical watches</strong>
      <br><br>
      As mentioned before mechanical watches are the oldest type. They are now
      the hardest(and the most expensive) to create. They're even not as accurate
      as other kinds are. But still they are by far the most expensive ones. people
      feel that these are 'real', watches and are willing to pay thousands of dollars
      for them.
      <br><br>
      <strong class= "subheadings">Electric watches</strong>
      <br><br>
      These watches are very uncommen. Not because they're really expensive, but
      because the 'quartz watch, which I'll talk about in a bit, just almost
      completly overshadows it, as previously mentioned. Maybe it is better to just
      a quartz watch. Still, if you like different mechanics used in this type, go
      for it, they are not bad, far from that actually, there are just better similair
      options.
      <br><br>
      <strong class= "subheadings">Quartz watches</strong>
      <br><br>
      Quartz watches are currently the most commen. With good reason, they're easiest
      to make. Factories can pump these things out like if it was nothing. They're also
      very cheap to make. To top that off, quartz watches are also the most precise watches
      of them all(except for atomic watches, but you'll probably barely ever see them).
      So these watches are the most accessible for a normal fellow. If you just want a
      watch for its functionality or if your budget isn't that big, this watch is
      perfect for you.
      <br><br>
      <strong class= "subheadings">Digital watches</strong>
      <br><br>
      Digital watches are pretty new and give us a fresh new option for our choosing.
      Digital watches can range from just a digital clock to watches
      with a touch screen and all new options that other portable devices also have,
      like being able to play music. If you don't like the class or if you're interested
      in the new options made avaible for them or if you just want the newest thing, these
      fresh guys are for you.
