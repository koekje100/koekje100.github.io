    <p class= "frontpage"> So, after all this, what do I like, what would I buy and
      wear proudly everyday? I've created a table below this with some important
      factors with me and I'm going to make a final verdict on that table in mind
      (The importance is scaled on a from 1 to 10).<br>
      There is also a video about another guy reviewing some watches. I always think
      it's important to have a second opinion, so have a watch if you like an extra look.

      Final verdict: I'd go for a Jaeger-Lecoultre, because I really like how they
      look. Plus some of them have some great add-ons. Though the price is high,
      it's not the highest.<br>
      I hope you can make a good choice now as well. Don't forget: this is just my
      opinion and I barely covered the tip of the iceberg. Have fun looking for your
      trusty companion!
